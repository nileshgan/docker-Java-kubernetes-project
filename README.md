**Project Overview:-**

As a developer, you will commit your code to Git repository. Now you have your whole project on Git Hub (central repository) and if it is public so anyone can access that code on his local machine with the help of git clone operation.
The code present in the git hub is only the base code, you don't have .jar or .war file. So you need to build your code with the help of Maven so that your code converts into a target file like .jar or .war
Then you have to write Dockerfile to convert it into a Docker image.
Once you build the Docker images push it into the Docker Hub registry.
Deploy the application onto the Kubernetes cluster (Minikube).

**Pre-requisite:-**

Java Application
Docker Installed
Kubernetes Cluster
Basic knowledge of Docker, Maven and Kubernetes.
